# LOAP - A Versioned Auditing tool based on the MerkleDAG and a Blockchain
The goal of our project is to combine two main technologies and provide a
versioned structure to publish files for later auditing.

This repository contains documents and the code used during and after the
[Blockchain Summer School 2017 in Copenhagen](http://blockchainschool.eu/)
(and hackathon). This solution has been developed by the Group 1 assigned on the
Maersk use case number 1.

## Problem
When files are modified in a chain of events by a set of untrusted entities,
a lot of errors may happen, making an invalid end result. Most of those errors
are caused by Human mistakes or data corruption/inconsistency.

## How to run the PoC

* `npm install` or `yarn`
* `npm run dev`
